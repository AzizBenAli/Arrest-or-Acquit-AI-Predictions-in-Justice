Arrest Prediction Classifier 🚓💡
Project Image

Overview 📋
This thrilling project focuses on developing a high-tech machine learning model to predict whether an individual should be arrested or not based on various features and circumstances recorded during traffic stops. We employ data analysis 🔍, feature engineering ⚙️, and machine learning wizardry to build and evaluate three different models: Random Forest 🌲, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 🧮, and a Stacked Ensemble Model 🚀.

Dataset 📊
We dived into a treasure trove of data 🗃️ containing information about traffic stops, including factors like state 🏞️, driver's gender 🚹🚺 and age 👴👵, race 🏁, violation type ⚠️, and more. The dataset underwent a magical transformation 🪄 through data preprocessing to ensure data quality and feature relevance.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing ✨
We waved our data-wand 🪄 to perform meticulous data cleaning 🧹 and preprocessing 🧰. Missing values vanished ✨, categorical variables were encoded 🎨, and features were transformed ✨, ensuring our data was ready for its journey through the enchanted forest of machine learning 🌲.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Our data exploration was an exciting adventure! We uncovered hidden treasures, deciphered cryptic patterns, and even revealed potential correlations between variables.

Model Building 🏗️
We summoned three powerful models:

Random Forest 🌲: An ensemble model with the wisdom of the forest, known for its accuracy and robustness.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet effective classification wizard based on the proximity of data points 📈.

Stacked Ensemble Model : A mighty alliance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models. This ensemble approach aimed to harness the strengths of each base model 🦄.

Model Evaluation 📊
We put our models to the test! They battled with metrics like accuracy 🎯, precision 🔍, recall 📢, and F1-score 📈 to determine which one would emerge victorious 🏆.

Results 🎉
After the epic showdown and relentless evaluation, we crowned the model that achieved the highest accuracy and overall predictive performance 🤩.

How to Use ⚙️
To embark on your own AI journey 🚀 and utilize the trained model for making predictions on new data 📋, follow these enchanted steps:

Data Preparation 🧹: Ensure your input data is as sparkling clean and magically preprocessed ✨ as the training data.

Model Inference 🧙‍♂️: Summon the selected machine learning model and use its mystical powers to predict whether an individual should face the handcuffs 🪣 or not 🏖️ based on the input features.
