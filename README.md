## Arrest Prediction Classifier 🚓💡


# Overview 📋
This thrilling project focuses on developing a high-tech machine learning model to predict whether an individual should be arrested or not based on various features and circumstances recorded during traffic stops. We employ data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning wizardry to build and evaluate three different models: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Stacked Ensemble Model.

# Dataset 📊
We dived into a treasure trove of data containing information about traffic stops, including factors like state , driver's gender and age, race, violation type, and more. The dataset underwent a magical transformation 🪄 through data preprocessing to ensure data quality and feature relevance.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing ✨
We waved our data-wand 🪄 to perform meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. Missing values vanished, categorical variables were encoded, and features were transformed, ensuring our data was ready for its journey through the enchanted forest of machine learning.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Our data exploration was an exciting adventure! We uncovered hidden treasures, deciphered cryptic patterns, and even revealed potential correlations between variables.

# Model Building 🏗️
We summoned three powerful models:

Random Forest: An ensemble model with the wisdom of the forest, known for its accuracy and robustness.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet effective classification wizard based on the proximity of data points.

Stacked Ensemble Model : A mighty alliance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models. This ensemble approach aimed to harness the strengths of each base model.

# Model Evaluation 📊
We put our models to the test! They battled with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which one would emerge victorious.

# Results 🎉
After the epic showdown and relentless evaluation, we crowned the model that achieved the highest accuracy and overall predictive performance.

# Deployment with Flask 🌐
To bring our most powerful model to life, we have harnessed the power of Flask, a web framework for Python. Flask enables us to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for making predictions based on traffic stop data. With Flask, we have developed a web application that allows users to input relevant information and receive instant predictions on whether an individual should be arrested.

## Using PythonAnywhere for Deployment 🚀
We've deployed our application using PythonAnywhere, a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to deploy, run, and host web applications in Python. You can access our application by clicking the following link:
